# "Original"
Dann nahm das andere, genauso fair
Und vielleicht die bessere Behauptung
Weil es grasig war und wollte tragen;
Obwohl das da passiert ist
Ich bezweifelte, ob ich jemals wiederkommen sollte
Das werde ich mit einem Seufzer erzählen
Irgendwo altert und altert folglich:
Zwei Straßen divergierten in einem Holz, und ich -
Ich habe die weniger befahren
Und das hat den Unterschied gemacht 

# Reference
Then took the other, as just as fair
And having perhaps the better claim
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
I doubted if I should ever come back
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled by
And that has made all the difference

# Vilém's literal translation:
Then I took the other one, equally good
and maybe it was a better decision
because it was grassy and I wanted to hold
Despite this happening
I doubted whether someone should come back
I would tell that to a drunker
Somewhere aging and aging consequently
two reads diverged in a wood and I
I took the less travelled one
and that made a difference

# Google translation
Then took the other, just as fair
And maybe the better claim
Because it was grassy and wanted to bear;
Although that's what happened
I doubted if I should ever come back
I'll tell you that with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages consequently:
Two roads diverged in one wood, and I -
I drove less
And that made the difference

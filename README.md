# MeanPoet

A metric for evaluating poetry translation (**mean**ing & **poet**icness).

Description TODO.

## Installation

Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

There are some rather complex dependencies.
Rhymetagger requires espeak which is a bit tricky to install (requires manual Makefile editing and running `ldconfig`).
